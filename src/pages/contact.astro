            Got an interesting project you're working on, or just want to say
            hi?
        </b>
        <p>
            I'd love to hear from you! The best way to reach me is through an
            email.

                This is a randomly generated email that I change regularly to prevent
                spam. So saving this as a contact for future communications is not
                suggested.
