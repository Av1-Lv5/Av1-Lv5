### Technical sheet code

-   Build using React js, typescript and vite build tool.
-   Used [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) a modern bookmark manager

### Random facts

-   Still a work in progress.
-   The problem i am trying to solve is that youtube's library doesn't have tag system and doesn't allow users to search content just within the library.
